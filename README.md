# trello-managed-cms
A resource card website using Trello as a CMS. All you need is a Trello account and a board. This project is only setup for handling public boards, though could be altered to expose private boards (which I don't recommend).

## Resource Cards
This project allows you to quickly setup and maintain a resource list in the style of http://marketingstack.io/.

## Getting going
1) Make a Trello account at https://trello.com/
2) Get yourself a Trello API key - https://developers.trello.com/
3) Make your board public (click on the Visibility button towards the top left of your board)
4) Add your board's ID to main.js (this is in the URL)
